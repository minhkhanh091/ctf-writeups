First, we can see that the ```main()``` function calls several other functions, but doesnâ€™t seem to contain much useful information itself. So I decided to analyze each called function in top-down order.

The first one is ```Sardinia()```. It appears to mainly check whether the flag was provided and validate its length. However, I noticed:

```C
Tuscany = (undefined4 *)operator.new(4);
*Tuscany = 0xbaadf00d;
Umbria = (undefined4 *)operator.new(4);
*Umbria = 0xbaadf00d;
```

Here, both ```Tuscany``` and ```Umbria``` are being allocated and initialized. They will likely be used later.

Next is ```Lazio()```. Overall, this function checks if the flag format is correct. A key section is:

```C
if (param_1[sVar2 - 1] == '}') {
strncpy(param_2,param_1 + 9,sVar2 - 10);
if (param_2[7] == 'm') {
    *Tuscany = 0xa2c8;
    cVar1 = param_2[0xd];
}
else {
    *Tuscany = 0x78b2;
    cVar1 = param_2[0xd];
}
if (cVar1 != 'T') {
    *Umbria = 0xe3f4;
    return 1;
}
*Umbria = 0x4fc1;
return 1;
}
```

This code extracts the flag content between {} and performs some checks. Notably, if ```flag[7] == 'm'```, then ```Tuscany = 0xa2c8```; otherwise, it's 0x78b2. Later, if the 13th character isn't 'T', Umbria is changed accordingly.

Moving on to ```Abruzz()```, it appears to dump some data into rawdata.txt. You can retrieve it simply by creating a file with that name.


Finally, in ```Calabria()```, the actual flag validation occurs through a series of XOR-like operations:

```C
local_43c = 0;
sVar2 = 0;
do {
sVar11 = sVar2;
uVar6 = (ulong)(byte)param_1[sVar11];
uVar6 = (ulong)local_438[sVar11] %
        (uVar6 + 0x25 + ((uVar6 * 0x25 + 0x17) * uVar6 + 9) * uVar6 * uVar6) & 0xff;
if ((uint)(byte)param_1[sVar11] + local_438[uVar6] != (&Apulia)[uVar6]) {
    local_43c = local_43c + 1;
}
sVar2 = sVar11 + 1;
} while (sVar4 != sVar11 + 1);
```

Each flag byte is used in calculations involving ```local_438``` and compared with ```Apulia```, which is the data dumped to rawdata.txt.

Now for how ```local_438``` is generated:

```C
uVar3 = *Tuscany * 0x10000 + *Umbria;
puVar8 = local_438;
do {
puVar9 = puVar8 + 1;
uVar6 = ((ulong)uVar3 * 0xbc8f) / 0x7fffffff;
uVar3 = (int)((ulong)uVar3 * 0xbc8f) - ((int)(uVar6 << 0x1f) - (int)uVar6);
*puVar8 = uVar3;
puVar8 = puVar9;
} while (local_38 != puVar9);
```

Clearly, ```local_438``` depends entirely on the values of ```Tuscany``` and ```Umbria```, which are determined earlier in ```Lazio()```. So, you can brute-force possible values derived from that logic to try different seeds.

Once both ```Apulia``` and ```local_438``` are known, you can brute-force the flag character-by-character. Here's an example script:

```python
apulia = [0x759f7565,0x4e10b5f6,0x60c0faf7,0x43db873e,...]
local_438 = [0x759f7518,0x4e10b5ad,0x60c0faa2, ...]
key = ""

for i in range(0, 20):
  for c in range(0x20, 0x7f):
    uVar6 = local_438[i] % (c + 0x25 + ((c * 0x25 + 0x17) * c + 9) * c  * c) & 0xff
    if (c + local_438[uVar6]) == apulia[uVar6]:
      key += chr(c)
      break

print(key)
```
