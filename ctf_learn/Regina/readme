Welcome to the CTFLearn.com Regina Reversing Challenge by kcbowhunter

After you solve the challenge you can view the source files by decrypting the sources.zip.enc file:

openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -in sources.zip -out sources.zip.enc -k kernel

where kernel is defined as: CTFlearn{kernel}

I'd love to hear your feedback on Discord or on the ctflearn.com page for this challenge; please leave a comment.

Solving Reverse Engineering problems requires knowledge of Assembly Language programming.
If you are new to assembly, here is a good web site to start learning: www.asmtutor.com

Good Luck!

I am available on Twitter @kcbowhunter and Discord to answer specific questions about my challenges, but you have to learn
Reverse Engineering and Assembly Language programming on your own.

Please do not post solutions to this challenge or any of my challenges to any website or blog or github.
Thank you.
